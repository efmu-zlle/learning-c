# C Practice

This repository contains my practice projects in the C programming language. These projects are inspired by and adapted from [Theo Webb's "C from Scratch" repository](https://github.com/theokwebb/C-from-Scratch/tree/main). Special thanks to Theo Webb for providing such a great resource to learn and practice C programming.

If you want to try these exercises yourself, check out the original repository: [C from Scratch](https://github.com/theokwebb/C-from-Scratch/tree/main).
